1. Create a sample spring boot application and configure H2 in memory database dependency.

notes:ðŸ”¹ Why Do We Need a Service Layer?

          Separation of Concerns
              The Service Layer acts as an intermediate layer between the Controller and Repository.
              It helps decouple the business logic from data access.

          Business Logic & Processing
              If in the future, you need to add validation, transformation, logging, or complex operations before saving employees, the Service Layer is where you do it.
              Example: Checking if an employee already exists before saving.

          Reusability & Maintainability
              The Service Layer can be reused by multiple controllers.
              If you directly call Repository from the Controller, you'd have to duplicate logic in different controllers.

      ðŸ”¹ Why Not Use Repository Directly in Controller?

      âœ… Bad Practice

          If the Controller calls EmployeeRepository.saveAll() directly, your Controller depends too much on database details.
          This makes your code tightly coupled and harder to change, test, and maintain.

      âœ… Better Approach

          Controller should handle HTTP requests only.
          Service Layer should handle business logic.
          Repository Layer should handle database operations.
